## Description

A web application used to track substitute musicians (not sandwiches) that play
various instruments, to be used as substitutes for performances when necessary.

For example, if a band normally has a trombone player and that individual is
sick and can't make it to a performance, we could select trombone from the list
of instruments to view a list of musicians that play trombone (with their
contact information). For every instrument we care to track substitute musicians
for, we have a list of musicians and their contact information.
